Hi everybody! Welcome to my blog. My name is Rachel Stratemeier and I am currently a student at Southern Methodist University in the Master of Science in Data Science program. Previously, I obtained an MBA in Business Analytics (also from SMU) and then worked in the oil and gas industry as a data analyst / systems analyst. I also have a law degree, but that doesn't come into play much. 

I'm very skilled in SQL and Microsoft SQL Server, as well as Excel (pivot tables, macros, etc), and know my way around Power BI. For programming languages, I know Python, Ruby, and R. I also am comfortable with Esri's ArcGIS. You can download my CV {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

Personally, my interests include dogs (I have two!), reading (all sorts of things), watching documentaries and action movies, and being that super organized person. This blog is going to be a combination of things I'm learning in school and things I'm learning in life, so feel free to only read the parts that interest you. I'm a pretty open book, so if there's anything else you want to know, just ask! Thanks for reading.
